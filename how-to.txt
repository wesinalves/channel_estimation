How to install

python3

virtualenv -p python3 venv

# Activate virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate

# Uses NVIDIA CUDA GPU
pip install tensorflow-gpu 

# For some reason Keras 2.2 does not load the models properly, I installed 2.1.6
pip install keras==2.1.6

# Install other requirements as well

# Deactivate
deactivate

# You will also need to clone Aldebaro's python repo

git clone https://gitlab.lasse.ufpa.br/software/ak-py.git
cp -r ak-py/akpy .

How to run

# Create a new model, trains it and saves to model.h5 file
# This will overwrite the previous model.h5 if it exists
python fres.py 

# Train the model loaded from model.h5 
python fres.py --mode=train

# Test the model loaded from model.h5 for SNR = [-21, 21]
# The test results (avg, min, max) are in 'mimo4x64' folder
# The filename is "all_nmse_snrdb_21_Nr{}_Nt{}_numEx256.txt"
python fres.py --mode=test

How to change SNR range for training 

# Change lines 82 and 83 of fres.py
min_randomized_snr_db = 20
max_randomized_snr_db = 22

---

How to change model architecture
# Uncomment one of the return lines of baseline_model function in fres.py
# For example 

def baseline_model():
    # return create_res3()
    # return create_lstm_conv() # this is actually not using LSTM, just Conv1D
    return create_deep_dense()

How to toggle and set ADC hysteresis

# Toggle hysteresis

shouldUseHysteresisQuantizer = True # or False 

# Set ADC hysteresis thresholds to a fixed standard deviation

shouldUseHysteresisQuantizer = True
if shouldUseHysteresisQuantizer:
    Y = hysteresis_quantize(Y, std=0.1)

How to use ray-tracing channels

# Should specify method in fres.py for both train and test
# Lines 101 and 601 of fres.py

method = "manual"

# This will load 8x8 channels form channel_data.mat on the same directory 

---

How to use randomized sparse channels

# Should specify method in fres.py for both train and test
# Around lines 101 and 601 of fres.py

method = "randomized_sparse"

# This will generate channels with a random number of clusters in angle domain

---

How to create channel_data.mat

# run Matlab script (select file inside script)
get_channels.m

# The ray-tracing files I have are 
Harray2.8GhzULA8x8s003.mat
Harray5GhzULA8x8s003.mat
Harray60GhzULA8x8s006.mat

# The channels are organized in 5 dimensions:
# (episodes, scene, receiver, Nr, Nt)
# I used only 1 receiver (3rd dimension fixed on 1)
